## Limit access to trusted OIDC Identity provider

* Controls that govern the authentication and authorization mechanisms used by external identity providers (IdPs) to grant access to your organization's resources.


| Service Provider | Rational | 
|-------------|-------------|
|[Default GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-hardening-your-deployments/configuring-openid-connect-in-amazon-web-services) | Help ensure that only repos and jobs from your tenant within github's SaaS environment can assume roles in AWS accounts in that are a member of your AWS organization using `AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity`. This control is effective when you're using the default issuer URL shared by all github enviroments of `tokens.actions.githubusercontent.com` and uses part of the "sub" (subject)  claim value to identify which tenant a given token calling AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity belongs to. For example, you can use StringLike`"repo:<octo-org>/*"`replacing <octo-org> with the expected value of your "enterprise slug" to deny access to your AWS accounts from github actions, except when the github action belongs to your tenant of github.|
|[Built in web identity providers (e.g., Facebook, Google, Login with Amazon, Cognito)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_iam-condition-keys.html#:~:text=Login%20with%20Amazon-,Facebook,-This%20tab%20explains) | Deny the use of the four built-in web identity providers (such as Google, Facebook, AWS Cognito and Login with Amazon) in AWS. Note: If you wish to allow usage for example, through AWS Cognito, you can leverage [IAM policy conditions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_iam-condition-keys.html#:~:text=Default-,Amazon,-Cognito) to specify which identity providers or types of federation can be used when accessing AWS resources as shown in this [example](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/iam-roles.html#trust-policies).|
